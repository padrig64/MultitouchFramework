Simple and flexible Java framework facilitating the handling of multitouch input and the gesture recognition.

Please refer to the [WIKI](https://github.com/padrig64/MultitouchFramework/wiki) for more information.

At first, this project was initiated to bring multitouch support for Swing-based (possibly GIS) applications. However, the deprecation of Swing, the rise of JavaFX and the rapid emergence of non-Java front-end technologies (supporting multitouch out-of-the-box) decreased the need for such a project.

Therefore, there is **no plan to continue** the development of this framework.
